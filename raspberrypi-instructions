Install Raspberry Pi OS (Lite) using the Raspberry Pi Imager here:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads.../

On the SD card before first boot:
  1. Enable SSH:
    In /boot/ create named "ssh" with no extension (in Windows, create a new text file called ssh.txt and then rename to remove the extension)
  2. Disable the Raspberry Pi Camera LED (we don't want to scare off the birds!):
    In /boot/config.txt:
    Add the following line to the end of the file, then save it.
    disable_camera_led=1
  3. Turn on the Wifi:
     Create a new file called "wpa_supplicant.conf"
     In this file, you will have to type in the required configuration to connect to the Wi-Fi network.  Just create a new file wpa_supplicant.conf and add the following lines to it. Be sure to make changes where necessary depending on your configuration. Finally, save the file.
      country=NZ
      ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
      update_config=1

      network={
        ssid="WIFI_SSID"
        scan_ssid=1
        psk="WIFI_PASSWORD"
        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
      }

    Change default password
    Set GPU memory to 16
